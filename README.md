# Hello World!
My name is Jonas Grube and I'm currently studying soething like "computer engineering" (the german name is "Ingenieurinformatik") at the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld , Germany or short FH Bielefeld.
I use GitHub to host small projects for myself, building tools I need or to try things I find interesting.

## Current projects
Currently I'm working on a project I named "pyDocToLaTeX" in which I try to extract the general structure and the corresponding documentation from python files and convert them into a nicely structured LaTeX documentation.
I wish to save a lot of time with this in upcoming projects for my course of studies.
Feel free to have a look at the project and maybe contribute some code or issues.
The documentation on GitHub is written in German but the program itself is in English and should be self explainatory. If not, feel free to ask.

## What I've already learned
In my course of studies and also by myself, I was able to learn the following languages and concepts:
- C 
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Matlab
- LaTeX
- TikZ
- OOP
- Datastructures
- UML
- Unittesting

Since we've always just scratched the surface of the languages and concepts, I would'nt call myself an advanced user, but I understood the key principles and therefore I am able to quickly adapt new concepts.
