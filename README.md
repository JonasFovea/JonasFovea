# Hello World!
My name is Jonas Grube and I'm currently studying soething like "computer engineering" (the german name is "Ingenieurinformatik") at the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld , Germany or short FH Bielefeld.
I use GitHub to host small projects for myself, building tools I need or to try things I find interesting.



## What I've already learned
In my course of studies and also by myself, I was able to learn the following languages and concepts:
- C 
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Matlab
- LaTeX
- TikZ
- OOP
- Datastructures
- UML
- Unittesting

Since we've always just scratched the surface of the languages and concepts, I would'nt call myself an advanced user, but I understand the key principles and therefore I am able to quickly adapt new concepts.
